diagram.mmd â€” Mermaid source for the main flowchart (your canonical diagram).

sequence_kafka.mmd and sequence_rabbit.mmd â€” Mermaid sources for the two sequence diagrams.

diagram.svg â€” SVG preview that embeds the Mermaid source as readable text (a true Mermaid renderer isnâ€™t available in this environment).

diagram.png â€” PNG preview that renders the Mermaid source as text (same caveat as above).

helm-charts/ â€” Helm chart skeletons for core components (scylla, kafka, rabbitmq, agent, orchestrator, n8n, spark) including Chart.yaml, values.yaml, and a simple templates/deployment.yaml.

k8s/ â€” Kubernetes manifest skeletons for Scylla, Kafka, RabbitMQ (StatefulSets/Deployments).

react-component/MermaidDiagram.jsx â€” interactive React component that uses the Mermaid CDN to render the diagrams client-side (drop-in into docs site).

README.txt â€” explains the bundle.

Real-Time Use Cases for ScyllaDB

IoT & Sensor Data Processing

Ingests high-velocity sensor streams.

Real-time anomaly detection, monitoring, and control.

Fraud Detection & Risk Management

Sub-millisecond lookups across large datasets.

Integration with stream processors (Kafka, Flink, Spark).

Recommendation Engines

Low-latency reads for personalization and recommendations.

Real-time updates as user interactions occur.

Ad Tech & Real-Time Bidding (RTB)

Must decide in tens of milliseconds.

ScyllaDB can sustain high QPS with strict SLAs.

Messaging & Communication Platforms

Stores and retrieves messages instantly across distributed systems.

Handles high concurrency with strong consistency tuning options.

Time-Series Data & Monitoring

Ingesting telemetry, metrics, or logs.

Querying recent data efficiently for dashboards and alerts.

ðŸ”— Typical Real-Time Architecture with ScyllaDB

Ingestion Layer: Kafka, Pulsar, or directly from application services.

Processing Layer: Stream processors (Flink, Spark, Akka, Faust).

Storage Layer: ScyllaDB as the low-latency, horizontally scalable data store.

Serving Layer: APIs, dashboards, or ML models serving predictions/alerts.

ðŸ›  Best Practices for Real-Time Deployments

Schema Design: Optimize for queries (wide-row patterns, time bucketing for time-series).

Consistency Tuning: Use QUORUM or LOCAL_QUORUM for balance between consistency and latency.

Hardware: NVMe SSDs, plenty of RAM, and high-core CPUs are recommended.

Monitoring: Use Scylla Monitoring Stack (Prometheus + Grafana) to track latencies and throughput.

CDC + Stream Integration: Capture changes and push to Kafka for event-driven pipelines.
