# Rate Limiter

References: [ByteByteGo](https://bytebytego.com/courses/system-design-interview/design-a-rate-limiter)

In a network system, a rate limiter is used to control the rate of traffic sent by a client or a service. In the HTTP world, a rate limiter limits the number of client requests allowed to be sent over a specified period. If the API request count exceeds the threshold defined by the rate limiter, all the excess calls are blocked

***HTTP 429 : response status code indicates a user has sent too many requests***

Almost all APIs published by large tech companies enforce some form of rate limiting.

Cloud microservices [4] have become widely popular and rate limiting is usually implemented within a component called API gateway. API gateway is a fully managed service that supports rate limiting, SSL termination, authentication, IP whitelisting, servicing static content, etc. For now, we only need to know that the API gateway is a middleware that supports rate limiting.

For example,
Twitter limits the number of tweets to 300 per 3 hours [2].
Google docs APIs have the following default limit: 300 per user per 60 seconds for read requests [3].

A rate limiter prevents DoS attacks, either intentional or unintentional, by blocking the excess calls.

## Algorithms for rate limiting

1. Token bucket
    - Both Amazon [5] and Stripe [6] use this algorithm to throttle their API requests.
2. Leaking bucket
    - Shopify, an ecommerce company, uses leaky buckets for rate-limiting
3. Fixed window counter
4. Sliding window log
5. Sliding window counter
